It includes the creation of two tables: `Departments` and `Employees`, along with sample data and several SQL queries to retrieve information. The project is aimed at demonstrating how to set up a basic employee database and perform common operations.

## SQL Queries
The project includes various SQL queries for retrieving information from the database.

- To select all employees and departments:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM Employees;
  SELECT * FROM Departments;
  ```

- To find employees by department ID:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE DepartmentID = 3;
  ```

- To find employees by department name (e.g., 'IT'):
  ```sql
  SELECT Employees.* FROM Employees
  INNER JOIN Departments ON Employees.DepartmentID = Departments.DepartmentID
  WHERE Departments.DepartmentName = 'IT';
  ```

- To select all data from employees and departments with department information:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM Employees
  LEFT JOIN Departments ON Employees.DepartmentID = Departments.DepartmentID;
  ```

- To select all data from employees and departments for a specific department (e.g., 'IT'):
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM Employees
  LEFT JOIN Departments ON Employees.DepartmentID = Departments.DepartmentID
  WHERE Departments.DepartmentName = 'IT';
  ```

- To calculate the average salary of all employees:
  ```sql
  SELECT AVG(salary) FROM Employees;
  ```
